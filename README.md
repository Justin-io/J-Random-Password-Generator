## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps carefully to set up the application on your machine.

### Step 1: Install Java

The application requires Java 17 or newer to run.

1.  **Download**: Go to the official [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) page.
2.  **Select your OS** (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the appropriate `JDK` (Java Development Kit).
3.  **Install**: Run the installer you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions.
4.  **Verify (Optional)**: Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) and type `java -version`. You should see the installed Java version.

### Step 2: Install MariaDB

This application uses MariaDB as its database.

1.  **Download**: Go to the official [MariaDB Downloads](https://mariadb.org/download/) page.
2.  **Select your OS** and download the stable version of **MariaDB Server**.
3.  **Install**: Run the installer.
    *   **Important**: During setup, you will be prompted to set a password for the `root` user. Remember this password!
    *   Ensure the "Install as service" option is checked (on Windows) so the database starts automatically.

### Step 3: Database Setup

You only need to do this once. The application will create its own database and table, but it needs a user to connect with.

1.  **Open a Database Client**:
    *   **Easy Way (GUI)**: Install a free tool like [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) (Windows) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) (Cross-Platform).
    *   **Command Line**: Open the MariaDB Command Prompt (from the Start Menu) or a regular terminal.

2.  **Connect to MariaDB**:
    *   In your client, connect to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` with the `root` user and the password you created in Step 2.

3.  **Create the User and Database**:
    Copy and paste the following SQL commands into your client's query window and execute them. This creates a dedicated user `appuser` that the application will use.

    ```sql
    -- Create a new user named 'appuser' that can only connect from localhost
    -- Replace 'YourStrongPassword123!' with a secure password of your choice.
    CREATE USER 'appuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourStrongPassword123!';

    -- Grant this user all permissions on the password_db database (which will be created by the app)
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON password_db.* TO 'appuser'@'localhost';

    -- Apply the changes
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

### Step 4: Download & Run the Application

1.  **Download the Source Code**:
    *   Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/justinalexia/J-Random-PassWord-Gen).
    *   Click the green `< > Code` button and select **Download ZIP**.
    *   Unzip the file to a location you can easily find, like `C:\Programs\PasswordGenerator`.

2.  **Compile the Code**:
    *   Open a Command Prompt or Terminal.
    *   Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files. For example: `cd C:\Programs\PasswordGenerator`
    *   Compile the Java file:
        ```bash
        javac PasswordGeneratorApp.java
        ```

3.  **Run the Application**:
    *   In the same terminal window, run the application:
        ```bash
        java PasswordGeneratorApp
        ```

#### üñ•Ô∏è For Windows Users: Create a One-Click Launcher

To avoid opening the command prompt every time, you can create a batch file.

1.  Inside the application folder, create a new text file.
2.  Rename it to `Run App.bat` (make sure you change the extension from `.txt` to `.bat`).
3.  Right-click `Run App.bat` and choose "Edit".
4.  Paste the following lines into the file, **adjusting the path** to where you unzipped the app:

    ```batch
    @echo off
    cd /d "C:\Programs\PasswordGenerator"
    java PasswordGeneratorApp
    ```
5.  Save the file. Now, you can just double-click `Run App.bat` to launch the application!

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Generate a Password**:
    *   Use the **Length Slider** to set the desired password length.
    *   Check the boxes for the character types you want to include (Uppercase, Lowercase, etc.).
    *   Click the **Generate** button. A new password will appear in the field.

2.  **Check Password Strength**:
    *   Below the password field, the **Strength Bar** will automatically update to show you how strong the generated password is.

3.  **Copy to Clipboard**:
    *   After generating a password, click the **Copy** button. The password is now on your clipboard and ready to be pasted anywhere.

4.  **Save a Password**:
    *   Click the **Save** button.
    *   A dialog will pop up asking for a **description** (e.g., "My Gmail Account," "Netflix Login").
    *   Enter a description and click **OK**. The password is now saved in your database.

5.  **Manage Saved Passwords**:
    *   Click the **Show Database** button to reveal the table of all your saved passwords.
    *   To delete a password, click on its row in the table to select it, then click the **Delete** button.
    *   Click **Hide Database** to collapse the table view again.

6.  **Exit the Application**:
    *   Click the **Exit** button or the red `‚úï` button in the top-right corner. A confirmation dialog will appear.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

If you changed the database password during setup, you must update the application's configuration.

1.  Open the `PasswordGeneratorApp.java` file in a text editor.
2.  Find these lines near the top of the file:
    ```java
    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/password_db";
    private static final String DB_USER = "appuser";
    private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "YourStrongPassword123!";
    ```
3.  Change the value of `DB_PASSWORD` to the new password you set for the `appuser`.
4.  Save the file and **recompile** it using the `javac` command from the installation guide.

## üêõ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: I get a "Database error" when I start the app.**
**A:** This is the most common issue. It means the application cannot connect to MariaDB.
*   **Check 1:** Is MariaDB running? On Windows, check Services for "MariaDB". On macOS/Linux, run `sudo systemctl status mariadb`.
*   **Check 2:** Did you complete [Step 3: Database Setup](#step-3-database-setup)? Ensure the `appuser` exists and the password in the `PasswordGeneratorApp.java` file matches exactly.
*   **Check 3:** Is your firewall blocking the connection? Ensure it allows connections to `localhost` on port `3306`.

**Q: The app window is blank or looks weird.**
**A:** This is usually a graphics or Java issue.
*   Make sure you have the latest graphics drivers for your computer.
*   Try updating your Java installation to the newest version.

**Q: I click "Run App.bat" and a window flashes and disappears.**
**A:** This means an error occurred on startup.
*   Edit the `.bat` file and add a new line: `pause`
    ```batch
    @echo off
    cd /d "C:\Programs\PasswordGenerator"
    java PasswordGeneratorApp
    pause
    ```
*   Now when you run it, the window will stay open and show you the error message.
